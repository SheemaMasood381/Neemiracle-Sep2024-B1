Project Object Classification with CNNs
Overview
In my internship project, I developed an interactive object Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is capable of classifying images with high accuracy and is accessible through a user-friendly web interface.

Key Features
Advanced CNN Architecture: Designed a robust CNN model with multiple layers, batch normalization, dropout, and advanced regularization techniques.
High Accuracy: Achieved 92% accuracy on test images and 87% on unseen images.
User-Friendly Web Interface: Users can upload images and receive instant classification results through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Flask
HTML/CSS
