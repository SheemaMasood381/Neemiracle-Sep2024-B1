## Project Object Classification with CNNs

## **Overview**

## Project Highlights:

üîç **Innovative Model Design:**

- **Advanced CNN Architecture:**
    Developed a Convolutional Neural Network with multiple layers, batch normalization, dropout, and advanced regularization, ensuring robustness and adaptability.
- **High Accuracy**:
    Achieved 92% accuracy on test images and 87% on unseen data, proving strong performance.
  
üåê **User-Friendly Web Interface**:

- **Effortless Uploads & Instant Results**:
   Users can upload images via an intuitive interface, and the system quickly classifies them, showing predictions alongside the images.
- **Engaging Design:**
   A visually appealing interface enhances the user experience.

  
üåê **Personal Touch & Unique Approach:**

- **Flexible Image Input:**
   Handles images of any size, with preprocessing to ensure accurate classification.
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing Pipeline:**
   Ensures accurate predictions regardless of original image size.
- **Acknowledgments:**
